# Alarm-Clock-App

## Project Description:
iOS alarm clock app that is able to play any audio file/youtube link as the alarm sound. Able to start mid-file and repeat at any point.

## Detailed requirements:
- Accepts .wav file as input and uses it as the alarm sound.
- Not sure on how to upload .wav file to the iPhone yet (cloud? IP upload?)
- Alarms can have customized snooze length.
- Able to start the alarm from the middle of the song and repeat at an arbitrary endpoint, or possibly just terminate.
- Able to pull song from a youtube link. Possibly cache the song on-device so a wifi connection is not necessary.

## Deadlines
