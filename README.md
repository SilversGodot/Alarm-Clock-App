# Alarm-Clock-App

## Project Description:
iOS alarm clock app that is able to play a .wav file or youtube link as the alarm sound. Able to start mid-file and repeat at any point.

## Detailed Requirements:
- Accepts .wav file as input and uses it as the alarm sound. File is obtained from iCloud.
- Alarms can have customized snooze length.
- Able to start the alarm from the middle of the song and repeat at an arbitrary endpoint, or possibly just terminate.
- Able to pull song from a youtube link. Possibly cache the song on-device so a wifi connection is not necessary.
- Alarms can be cancelled early. E.g., if you wake up 5 minutes before the alarm, you can close it so it doesn't go off.
